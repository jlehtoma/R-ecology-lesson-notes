**TARGET TIME: 15 min**

## Learning Objectives

 After completing this module, the learner should be able to:

 * Organize files and directories related to a particular set of analyses in an
   R Project within RStudio
 * Define the following (as they apply to R): Script, function, working
   directory, assign, object, variable
 * Describe the purpose of the RStudio script, console, environment, and plot
   windows
 * Assign values to variables
 * Call functions with zero or more named or unnamed arguments
 * Use the built-in RStudio help interface to search for more information on R
   functions
 * Ask for help from the R user community, providing sufficient information for
   the problem to be reproduced and troubleshooted

------------

# Before we get started

1. Start RStudio (presentation of RStudio -below- should happen here)
1. Under the `File` menu, click on `New project`, choose `New directory`, then
  `Empty project`
1. Enter a name for this new folder (or "directory", in computer science), and
   choose a convenient location for it. This will be your **working directory** for the rest of the day (e.g., `~/data-carpentry`)
1. Click on "Create project"
1. Under the `Files` tab on the right of the screen, click on `New Folder` and
   create a folder named `data` within your newly created working directory. (e.g., `~/data-carpentry/data`)
1. Create a new R script (File > New File > R script) and save it in your working
   directory (e.g. `data-carpentry-script.R`)

Your working directory should now look like this:

![How it should look like at the beginning of this lesson](img/r_starting_how_it_should_like.png)

## Organizing your working directory

+ Be consistent
+ Folder tree:
  + **`data/`**
    + Differentiate between raw and processed data
  + **`documents/`** 
  + **`scripts/`** 

You may want additional directories or subdirectories depending on your project
needs, but these should form the backbone of your working directory. **For this
workshop, you only need a `data/` folder.**

# Presentation of RStudio

Let's start by learning about [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

## 1. FOSS (AGPL-3)

## 2. We use RStudio for

1. Write code
2. Navigate files
3. Inspect variables
4. Visualize plots
5. Creating reproducible reports

In addition, it can be used for e.g.:

1. Version control
2. Package development
3. Writing interactive web apps

## 3. Structure of RStudio

1. 4 panes
2. Shortcuts
3. Auto-completion
4. Code highlighting

-> not just neat, **helps you spot and/or avoid errors**.


# Interacting with R

1. Code
2. Commands
3. Execution (running)


+ Two main ways of interacting with R:
  1. Console
  2. Scripts

+ Show in RStudio: 
  + Console
    + `>` and `+`, when is the console expting more
  + At some point, it might be a good idea to save the text into a file (show, and **Ctrl + Enter**)
  + Lots of keyboard shortcuts (Shift+Alt+K)

# Basics of R

R is a versatile, open source programming/scripting language that's useful both
for statistics but also data science. Inspired by the programming language S.

* Free/Libre/Open Source Software under the [GPL version 2](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).
* Superior (if not just comparable) to commercial alternatives. R has over 7,000
  user contributed packages at this time. It's widely used both in academia and
  industry.
* Available on all platforms.
* Not just for statistics, but also general purpose programming.
* For people who have experience in programmming: R is both an object-oriented
  and a so-called [functional language](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html).
* Large and growing community of peers.

## The R syntax

_Start by showing an example of a script_

* Point to the different parts:
  - a function
  - the assignment operator `<-`
  - the `=` for arguments
  - the comments `#` and how they are used to document function and its content
  - the `$` operator
* Point to indentation and consistency in spacing to improve clarity

![Example of a simple R script](img/r_starting_example_script.png)

1. Commenting
2. Assignment operator
  + Demonstrate **the hotkey (Alt + -)**
3. Functions and their arguments
  + "Canned scripts"
  + Many functions available from *packages*
  + Most, but not all, return a value
  + Running a function = calling a function (show `sqrt()`)
  + Return types can be various things
  + Arguments to function can too be many things; some are required some are not

Let's try a function that can take multiple arguments: `round()`.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159)
```

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
args(round)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
?round
```

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159, digits = 2)
```

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
round(3.14159, 2)
```

And if you do name the arguments, you can switch their order:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
round(digits = 2, x = 3.14159)
```

**Required arguments first**, followed by optional arguments.

# Seeking help

## I know the name of the function I want to use, but I'm not sure how to use it

If you need help with a specific function, let's say `barplot()`, you can type:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
?barplot
```

If you just need to remind yourself of the names of the arguments, you can use:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
args(lm)
```

## I want to use a function that does X, there must be a function for it but I don't know which one...

If you are looking for a function to do a particular task, you can use
`help.search()` function, which is called by the double question mark `??`.
However, this only looks through the installed packages for help pages with a
match to your search request

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
??kruskal
```

If you can't find what you are looking for, you can use the
[rdocumention.org](http://www.rdocumentation.org) website that searches through
the help files across all packages available.

## I am stuck... I get an error message that I don't understand

Start by googling the error message. However, this doesn't always work very well
because often, package developers rely on the error catching provided by R. You
end up with general error messages that might not be very helpful to diagnose a
problem (e.g. "subscript out of bounds"). If the message is very generic, you might
also include the name of the function or package you're using in your query.

However, you should check StackOverflow. Search using the `[r]` tag. Most
questions have already been answered, but the challenge is to use the right
words in the search to find the answers:
[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r)

The [Introduction to R](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf) can
also be dense for people with little programming experience but it is a good
place to understand the underpinnings of the R language.

The [R FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html) is dense and technical
but it is full of useful information.

## Asking for help

The key to get help from someone is for them to grasp your problem rapidly. You
should make it as easy as possible to pinpoint where the issue might be.

Try to use the correct words to describe your problem. For instance, a package
is not the same thing as a library. Most people will understand what you meant,
but others have really strong feelings about the difference in meaning. The key
point is that it can make things confusing for people trying to help you. Be as
precise as possible when describing your problem.

If possible, try to reduce what doesn't work to a simple *reproducible
example*. If you can reproduce the problem using a very small `data.frame`
instead of your 50,000 rows and 10,000 columns one, provide the small one with
the description of your problem. When appropriate, try to generalize what you
are doing so even people who are not in your field can understand the
question. For instance instead of using a subset of your real dataset, create a
small (3 columns, 5 row) generic one. For more information on how to write a
reproducible example see [this article by Hadley Wickham](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html).

To share an object with someone else, if it's relatively small, you can use the
function `dput()`. It will output R code that can be used to recreate the exact
same object as the one in memory:

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
dput(head(iris)) # iris is an example data.frame that comes with R
```

If the object is larger, provide either the raw file (i.e., your CSV file) with
your script up to the point of the error (and after removing everything that is
not relevant to your issue). Alternatively, in particular if your questions is
not related to a `data.frame`, you can save any R object to a file:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
saveRDS(iris, file="/tmp/iris.rds")
```

The content of this file is however not human readable and cannot be posted
directly on stackoverflow. It can however be sent to someone by email who can
read it with this command:

```{r, eval=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
some_data <- readRDS(file="~/Downloads/iris.rds")
```

Last, but certainly not least, **always include the output of `sessionInfo()`**
as it provides critical information about your platform, the versions of R and
the packages that you are using, and other information that can be very helpful
to understand your problem.

```{r, results='show', purl=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```

## Where to ask for help?

* Your friendly colleagues: if you know someone with more experience than you,
  they might be able and willing to help you.
* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r): if your question
  hasn't been answered before and is well crafted, chances are you will get an
  answer in less than 5 min. Remember to follow their guidelines on [how to ask
  a good question](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).
* The [R-help mailing list](https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help): it is
  read by a lot of people (including most of the R core team), a lot of people
  post to it, but the tone can be pretty dry, and it is not always very
  welcoming to new users. If your question is valid, you are likely to get an
  answer very fast but don't expect that it will come with smiley faces. Also,
  here more than everywhere else, be sure to use correct vocabulary (otherwise
  you might get an answer pointing to the misuse of your words rather than
  answering your question). You will also have more success if your question is
  about a base function rather than a specific package.
* If your question is about a specific package, see if there is a mailing list
  for it. Usually it's included in the DESCRIPTION file of the package that can
  be accessed using `packageDescription("name-of-package")`. You may also want
  to try to email the author of the package directly, or open an issue on the
  code repository (e.g., GitHub).
* There are also some topic-specific mailing lists (GIS, phylogenetics, etc...),
  the complete list is [here](http://www.r-project.org/mail.html).
