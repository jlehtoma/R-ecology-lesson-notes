## 3. How the workshop works (practices)

### Code of Conduct

http://www.datacarpentry.org/code-of-conduct/

We are committed to creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, 
teaching and contributing. All participants in Data Carpentry events or 
communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others.

### Sticky notes.

We give each learner two sticky notes of different colors,e.g., red and green. 
These can be held up for voting, but their real use is as status flags.
If someone has completed an exercise and wants it checked, they put the green 
sticky note on their laptop; if they run into a problem and need help, the put 
up the red one. This is better than having people raise their hands because:

* it's more discreet (which means they're more likely to actually do it),
* they can keep working while their flag is raised, and
* the instructor can quickly see from the front of the room what state the class 
is in.

### Minute cards.

As explained [yesterday]({{ page.root }}/06-summarize/), we also use sticky 
notes as minute cards: before each coffee or meal break, learners take a minute 
to write one positive thing on the green sticky note (e.g., one thing they've 
learned that they think will be useful), and one thing they found too fast, too 
slow, confusing, or irrelevant on the red one.  They can use the red sticky 
note for questions that haven't yet been answered.  It only takes a few minutes 
to cluster these, and allows the instructors to adjust to learners' interests 
and speed.

### One up, one down. 

We frequently also ask for summary feedback at the end of each day. The 
instructors ask the learners to alternately give one positive and one negative 
point about the day, without repeating anything that has already been said. 
This requirement forces people to say things they otherwise might not: once 
all the "safe" feedback has been given, participants will start saying what 
they really think.

Minute cards are anonymous; the alternating up-and-down feedback is not.
Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses, and by providing both, we hope 
to get the best of both worlds.

### Collaborative note-taking.

We often use [Etherpad][etherpad] for collaborative note-taking and to share 
snippets of code and small data files with learners. (If nothing else, it 
saves us from having to ask students to copy long URLs from the presenter's 
screen to their computers.) It is almost always mentioned positively in 
post-workshop feedback, and several workshop participants have started using 
it in their own teaching.

One of the advantages of collaborative note-taking is that it gives the more 
advanced learners in the class something useful to do. Another is that the 
notes the learners take are usually more helpful *to them* than those the 
instructor would prepare in advance, since the learners are more likely to 
write down what they actually found new, rather than what the instructor 
predicted would be new.

Finally, scanning the Etherpad is a good way for an instructor to discover 
that class didn't hear something important, or misunderstood it.

### Pair programming.

Pairing is a good practice in real life, and also [a good way to teach]({{ page.root }}/files/papers/porter-what-works-2013.pdf). Partners can not only help each 
other out during the practical, but can also clarify each other's 
misconceptions when the solution is presented, and discuss common research 
interests during breaks. To facilitate this, we strongly prefer flat 
(dinner-style) seating to banked (theater-style) seating; this also 
makes it easier for helpers to reach learners who need assistance.

When pair programming is used it's important to put *everyone* in pairs, 
not just the learners who are struggling, so that no one feels singled 
out. It's also useful to have people sit in new places (and hence pair 
with different partners) after each coffee or meal break.

## 4. Schedule for the coming days

## 5. Have everyone introduce themselves to their neighbours
